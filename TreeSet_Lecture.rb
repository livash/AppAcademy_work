#Tree Set

#####Binary Search Tree
# root, inner node, leaves(elements with no children)
# Self balancing trees (rebalance tree height). The shorter the tree height, the faster will be search and insertion operations

@root = 100
@root.insert(200)
@root.insert(90)

#fully balnced tree - each level of the binary tree is filled
# level 1 = @root
# level 2 = 2 children
# level 3 = 4 children
# level 4 = 8 children

#In order to insert into the tree, we have to make a number of comparisons, which is equal to the depth of the tree
# HOw deep is the perfectly balanced tree?

#How many nodes in a fully-balanced BT of  7 levels?
# A sum( 2^n ) where n = 0 to n = 7
